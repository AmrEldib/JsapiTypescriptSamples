## Setup Instructions ##
- Download and setup the code as an application in IIS.
- The code assumes that [Esri's proxy](https://github.com/Esri/resource-proxy) is setup as another application named 'EsriProxy'.
- To make things easier, turn off the filtering of the proxy by switching the value of the 'mustMatch' attribute to 'false'.
